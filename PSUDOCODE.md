# This is the Psudo code Explaination for SpaceDoc
<strong>A place to share your documents </strong>
 
<p>This is a complete guide to show how i have written the code and its backend </p>

<strong> Software needed to build the entire site </strong>
<ul><li> Visual Studio Code - software</li>
<li> Live server- Extension for viewing our site while coding </li>
 <li> Balsamiq farmework - To design how our website will look </li>
  <li> Firebase - For all the backend (Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.)</li>
</ul>

<br> <b>SETTING UP FIREBASE</b> </br>

<strong> The Api keys are personal and these data cannot be shared on internet so i have removed that part from the image <strong>
 <img src="Resources/api.png"  alt="Firebase AuthenticationSetting up Api">
 <p> Follow same guide line or you can read the entire documentation from firebase </p>
 <p> Make sure to link all firebase codes and script attact to your jaavascript to ensure proper running of code <br> 
  Due to shortage of time i have written things in breif </p>
